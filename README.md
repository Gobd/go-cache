# go-cache

go-cache is an in-memory key:value store/cache similar to memcached that is
suitable for applications running on a single machine. Its major advantage is
that, being essentially a thread-safe `map[string]interface{}` with expiration
times, it doesn't need to serialize or transmit its contents over the network.

Any object can be stored, for a given duration or forever, and the cache can be
safely used by multiple goroutines.

Removed increment, decrement, save, load, newfrom. Added a `NewLazy` function
that creates a cache that only updates `time.Now()` every `timeNowInterval`
might be faster than the original or not. The benchmarks in the package show
it to be generally faster but sometimes slower. Other benchmarks written to be
more realistic show it 133x faster. Hasn't been in production so not really sure.

### Installation

`go get github.com/Gobd/go-cache`

### Usage

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/Gobd/go-cache"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Create a cache with a default expiration time of 5 minutes, and which
	// purges expired items every 10 minutes
	c := cache.New(5*time.Minute, 10*time.Minute)

	// Set the value of the key "foo" to "bar", with the default expiration time
	c.Set("foo", "bar", cache.DefaultExpiration)

	// Set the value of the key "baz" to 42, with no expiration time
	// (the item won't be removed until it is re-set, or removed using
	// c.Delete("baz")
	c.Set("baz", 42, cache.NoExpiration)

	// Get the string associated with the key "foo" from the cache
	foo, found := c.Get("foo")
	if found {
		fmt.Println(foo)
	}

	// Since Go is statically typed, and cache values can be anything, type
	// assertion is needed when values are being passed to functions that don't
	// take arbitrary types, (i.e. interface{}). The simplest way to do this for
	// values which will only be used once--e.g. for passing to another
	// function--is:
	foo, found := c.Get("foo")
	if found {
		MyFunction(foo.(string))
	}

	// This gets tedious if the value is used several times in the same function.
	// You might do either of the following instead:
	if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
		foo := x.(string)
		// ...
	}
	// or
	var foo string
	if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
		foo = x.(string)
	}
	// ...
	// foo can then be passed around freely as a string

	// Want performance? Store pointers!
	c.Set("foo", &MyStruct, cache.DefaultExpiration)
	if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
		foo := x.(*MyStruct)
			// ...
	}
}
```
